If you can spot what's wrong with this code you get a cookie. Apparently rendering with a 302 breaks ie6 entirely. Just deleting the 302 makes it okay.

<code>
render :partial => 'admin/restricted', :layout => 'admin', :status => "302" and return false
</code>

Whether it makes sense or not is not the question. I'm pretty confident that it doesn't make sense after thinking about it for a while. But why would it make ie6 connections die while firefox et al are fine with it?
