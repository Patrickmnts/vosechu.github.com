### Reading to do before class

### Resources
* [https://gist.github.com/vosechu/4972906](https://gist.github.com/vosechu/4972906)

* [http://addyosmani.com/blog/essential-js-namespacing/#beginners](http://addyosmani.com/blog/essential-js-namespacing/#beginners)

### Helpful Commands
* ⌘ + ⌥ + J to open the console in chrome
* ⌘ + ⇧ + U to open the page source
* `debugger` anywhere in your javascript file

### Exercises

#### Stage 1 (remembering/understanding)

* Answer these questions with your pair
  * How to make a variable that contains an integer, float, string, and array
  * How do you stop the browser and enter debugging mode?
  * What does it mean to `continue`, `step over`, and `step into` when in debugging mode?
  * How do you safely detect whether a variable has been defined or null?
  * How do you check whether a variable is empty?
  * <> Insert examples that demonstrate Overriding, Hoisting, Shadowing, and Scoping
  * What does it mean to be "function scoped"?

#### Stage 2 (application/analyzing)
* Write code on the board (or on paper), which has a function nested within a function. Annotate the different block scopes. Instead of a nested function, use an if statement, then annotate the block scopes.
* Using the gist above, simulate overriding, hoisting, shadowing, and scoping.
* Without using jQuery, create a ‘rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock’ application. Using prompt() ask the user to input their choice. The computer should always choose 'Spock' because it's the most awesome answer. Declare victory or loss.
  * Things you may need: `prompt`, `alert`, `console.log`, `debugger`, `switch`

#### Boss Fight (evaluation/creation)
* Install an automatic JS Linter into Sublime. Write up instructions and put them on the wiki on a page called Week 3.
* Evaluate the types of namespacing in Addy Osmani’s article. Defend your choice to the class and explain why namespacing is important during reflection time.
* Finish up the app above by allowing the computer to randomly select. Allow repeated plays. Ensure that you see the computer select all 5 possible actions!

gem install thin; rackup -s thin
brew install curl
curl -X POST -H "Content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "key=value" -d "key2=value2" http://localhost3001
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercises
#### Stage 1 (remembering/understanding)
* Answer these questions with your pair
  * What is the one function that every Rack app must include?
  * What must the hash look like when the main Rack function returns?
  * Why was Rack created?
  * What is the difference between POST and GET?
  * How do you get the values that were submitted to a Rack app?

#### Stage 2 (application/analyzing)
* Get rack running with rackup (on a port other than 4567), create a hello world
* Create a form and submit the values, via POST, to your running rack application
* Make your rack application print out the values you submitted from the form (using RackRequest)
* Try to read through the code in TryStatic, what is it doing? What parts have you never seen before?
* Try running Rack with an app server other than Webrick. Thin and Mongrel are popular choices.

#### Boss Fight (evaluation/creation)

### Helpful Commands
{% highlight bash %}
gem install watchr
watchr test.watchr
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercises
#### Stage 1 (remembering/understanding)
* Answer these questions with your pair
  * What is the difference between an instance method and a class method?
  * How do I write a module that adds instance methods?
  * How do I write a module that adds class methods?
  * How do I get these methods into my class and instance?
  * What is the value of testing over personally validating the output?
  * How do I write tests in the same file I’m working in?
  * How do I write tests in an external file or files?
  * What is a symbol and why do we use them?
  * What is a struct and why would I use it over a class?

#### Stage 2 (application/analyzing)
* Go back to your HQ9F class and add autorun tests to it. Verify that h, HQ9F._99, and HQ9F.new.f all work with a variety of inputs. Try to use assert_output instead of assert_equal like in my example.
* If you can’t get assert_output working, what would you need to change to make assert_equal work? This is generally why `puts` is avoided in other Ruby programs in favor of Logger.info or something else.
* Which cases did I miss in my testing? Write a test for some of those cases.

#### Boss Fight (evaluation/creation)
* Attempt to integrate Watchr or autotest to automatically run your tests. Optionally get this working with Growl so you don’t even have to leave your editor. (You may need the gem rb-fsevent). Write up documentation about what watchr script you wrote and put it on the wiki.
* Download the Rubinius or Ruby source and look through the lib or ext folders and find 3 other modules that might be interesting to include/extend. Tell us about these modules in reflection time.
