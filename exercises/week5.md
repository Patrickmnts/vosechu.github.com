## Monday &mdash; 3/4/2013
### Topics
* Sinatra

### Goals
* Understand Sinatra, routing, and templates

### Definitions
* Sinatra: Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort
* Route: A route is an HTTP method paired with a URL-matching pattern.
* Template: A template is a generic HTML file with some way to allow you to insert context-appropriate data directly. The most common is the layout file.

### Important Threshold Concepts

### Reading to do before class
* [Sinatra README](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html)
* [ERB README](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html)

### Resources
* [EventSource JS Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events)
* [Original chat app by rkh (not working anymore)](https://gist.github.com/rkh/1476463)
* [Sinatra-contrib](http://www.sinatrarb.com/contrib/)

### Helpful Commands
{% highlight bash %}
gem install sinatra-gen

# Generate the project. --tiny uses 'classic' sinatra
sinatra-gen sinatra-long-poll --tiny --test=spec --views=erb get:/subscribe post:/message

# Start the server properly
RACK_ENV=development be ruby sinatra-long-poll.rb
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'erb'
# Compile the template (but don't fill in the values yet)
template = ERB.new "The value of x is: <%= @x %>"

# Prepare the values for inclusion in ERB
@x = 42

# Use the variables in the current scope and pass them to `result`
puts template.result(binding) #=> The value of x is: 42
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercises

#### Stage 1 (remembering/understanding)

* Answer these questions with your pair
  * What is Sinatra
  * What is a route
  * What is a named parameter
  * What is a splat parameter
  * What is a template
  * What folder can I put static assets in
  * How do you use an ERb file
  * Where is the default layout file located
  * How do you specify a non-default layout
  * How do you pass variables to the template
  * How do you redirect to another page

#### Stage 2 (application/analyzing)

* I've built a chat script but it has a couple bugs and it's missing some features
* Start off by getting the app running.
* In a small group, try to tackle each of the TODOs. Brainstorm them first and make sure you understand the problem.
* Make sure that you can access each other's chat room.

#### Boss Fight (evaluation/creation)

* Rather than relying on params for the username, rely on a session
* Add in Rack::Test to ensure that at least the first couple of routes are working. Don't test the long-polling stuff.
* Add in a rake task to send a POST for manual testing

## Tuesday &mdash; 3/5/2013
### Topics
* Object-oriented Programming (OOP)
* Law of Demeter
* Responsibility-driven Design

### Goals
* Understand Dynamic dispatch, encapsulation, inheritance/delegation, open recursion (this/self)
* Understand Law of Demeter / Responisibilty-driven Design

### Important Concepts
* Things (objects/nouns) vs actions (methods/verbs)

### Reading to do before class
* [Object-oriented Programming for non-tech users](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/34588/5942)
* [Object-oriented Design Process](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1101138/203731)

### Resources
* [Law of Demeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter)
* [Object-oriented Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Oriented_Programming#Fundamental_features_and_concepts)
* [Responsibility-driven Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility-driven_design)

### Helpful Commands
{% highlight bash %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercises

#### Stage 1 (remembering/understanding)

* Pair these statements
  * Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units
  * Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers
  * What actions is this object responsible for?
  * What information does this object share?
  * When a method is invoked on an object, the object itself determines what code gets executed
  * The creation of self-contained modules that bind processing functions to their data.
  * "x" Enforces Modularity
  * Classes are created in hierarchies, and "x" allows the structure and methods in one class to be passed down the hierarchy.
  * "x" Passes "Knowledge" Down
  * A special variable (syntactically it may be a keyword), usually called this or self, that allows a method body to invoke another method body of the same object.

* With these philosophies or concepts
  * Law of Demeter
  * Responsibility-driven Design
  * Dynamic Dispatch
  * Encapsulation
  * Inheritance/Delegation
  * Open Recursion
